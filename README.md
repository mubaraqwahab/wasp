# Wasp 🐝

A little dialect of Lisp I'm building to learn about compilers.

This is based on a [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) course, [_Building Your Own Programming Language_](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/programming-language). (See [course repo](https://github.com/stevekinney/dropbear).)

<!--

## Motivation?

* I don't intend to build a programming language
* Templating languages and other meta languages
* Static analysis of programs; formatters, linters, autocompletion.
